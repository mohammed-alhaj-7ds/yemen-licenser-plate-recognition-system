        "We documented the **Yemen Vehicle License Plate Recognition & Vehicle Segmentation** pipeline: dataset (Roboflow vehicle-segmentation), YOLOv8-Seg architecture, training, evaluation metrics (IoU, mAP50, Precision, Recall), and sample predictions. The trained model is stored at `ai/models/vehicle_segmentation.pt` and used in the AI pipeline for vehicle segmentation, plate detection, OCR, and governorate extraction."
